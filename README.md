# advert-free-radio
This program will take a live radio stream and replace annoying adverts by music similar to what was playing from your music library. It recognizes adverts by audio fingerprinting and querying it with an existing library. WIP.

Download and install the following dependencies:
- [acrcloud](https://github.com/acrcloud/acrcloud_sdk_python)

```
## Instructions
